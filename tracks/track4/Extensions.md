# Extensions

Your baseline is the assistant from [Building your Application]({% link tracks/track-1/building-application.md %}). Everything here is on top of that.

## 1. Add a user interface

Your assistant is an HTTP endpoint, which is enough for grading but not much to look at. A chat UI makes it easy to demo and to test by hand.

{: .tip }
> [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com) is an open-source chat interface you can point at your assistant. It speaks the OpenAI chat format, so you will likely add a thin adapter between it and your `/chat` endpoint, or expose an OpenAI-compatible route alongside it.

## 2. Extend to larger dataset

You can ask organisers for a much larger dataset if you want to stress-test your retrieval and grounding at a larger scale.

The graded questions are about the provided corpus, so this is about robustness and higher-scale implementation.

## 3. Your own extension

Free choice. If you have an idea that makes the assistant more useful, safer, or more interesting, build it. A few directions to spark ideas:

- other questions that may be useful for OSINT agency analyzing misinformation campaign, 
- given the larger dataset, automatize detection of different nicknames corresponding to the same person/event( e.g. "Donald Trump", "Drumpf", “45 and 47”, "DJT").
