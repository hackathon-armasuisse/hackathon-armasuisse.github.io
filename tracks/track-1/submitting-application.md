# Submitting Application

{: .summary }
> **In short:** you deploy your own application on your team VM. By the deadline it must be **running and reachable**, serving `/chat` and `/post/*` on port **8080**, and you submit its URL through the form along with your GitHub repository and the commit you tagged.

## You deploy it yourself

We do not clone or build your application. You run it on your team VM and keep it running:

```
docker build -t track1 .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 \
  -v <corpus-dir>:/corpus:ro --env-file inference.env track1
```

- Serve `/chat` and `/post/*` on port **8080**
- Mount the data read-only at **`/corpus`** (the `CORPUS_DIR` variable defaults to it), with the layout given in [Building your Application]({% link tracks/track-1/building-application.md %}#running-in-a-container).
- Pass the inference variables from `inference.env`. Read these exact variable names, do not hard-code them:

  | Variable | Value |
  |---|---|
  | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `https://litellm.intlab.ch/v1` |
  | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | provided on Monday morning |
  | `MODEL` | provided later |

## Before you submit

Check that:

- [ ] it is **running on your VM** and answers `/chat` and `/post/*` on port 8080;
- [ ] it reads the data path and inference variables from the environment (nothing hard-coded to one machine);
- [ ] responses follow the [I/O contract]([Building your Application]({% link tracks/track-1/building-application.md %}#the-chat-endpoint));
- [ ] your tool seed (`tools_seed_data.json`) is in your image, and the corpus `.txt` files are read from `/corpus`;
- [ ] a top-level **`README.md`** notes anything non-obvious about your build.

## Handing in

By the deploy-and-freeze deadline, submit through the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/ijNGXvWJDfQKQnWPA):

- your **GitHub repository URL**, and
- the **commit hash** you tagged `v1`.

The repository is how we verify and judge what you built; the URL is what gets attacked.

## After the deadline

1. We check that your endpoint answers, and run the acceptance battery against it.
2. Your endpoint URL is published to the other teams for the red-team phase.
3. The VM at the time of deployment is **frozen**, and you may not change it until the Thursday blue-team session.

In that Thursday session you may add guardrails and redeploy. Tag the commit you
finish with as `final` and send us the new hash; the endpoint URL stays the same.
